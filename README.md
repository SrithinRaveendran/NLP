STEPS INVOLVED

Imported Necessary Libraries
Importing essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, and Scikit-learn. These libraries provide the necessary functions and tools for data manipulation, visualization, preprocessing, and machine learning.

Data Visualization
Using visualization tools to understand the distribution and patterns in the dataset. This step includes creating plots such as histograms, bar charts to get insights into the data and identify any potential trends.

Removal of Unwanted Columns
Eliminating columns that are not useful for the analysis, such as IDs or unrelated text fields. This step helps in reducing noise and focusing on relevant data for sentiment analysis.

Tokenization
Splitting the text into individual words or tokens. Tokenization is a crucial step in text preprocessing, converting the text into a format that can be easily analyzed and processed by machine learning algorithms.

Removal of Special Characters
Cleaning the text data by removing special characters, punctuation, and numbers that do not contribute to the sentiment analysis. This step ensures that only meaningful words are retained.

Stemming
Reducing words to their root form. For example, "running" becomes "run". Stemming helps in standardizing words and reducing the complexity of the data by treating different forms of a word as the same.

Stopword Removal
Removing common words that do not carry significant meaning, such as "and," "the," "is," etc. This step helps in focusing on the words that contribute the most to the sentiment of the text.

Vectorization
Converting text data into numerical format using techniques like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), or word embeddings. This step allows the machine learning model to process the text data.

Train-Test Splitting
Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance. This step helps in assessing the model's generalizability to new, unseen data.

Model Creation
Building and training a machine learning model using the preprocessed data. This step involves selecting an appropriate algorithm (e.g., Decisiontreeclassifier, SVM, KNN,Naive bayes) and training it on the training data to learn the patterns and relationships in the text.

Performance Evaluation
Assessing the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. This step ensures that the model is effective in predicting sentiment and helps identify areas for improvement.
